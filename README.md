###README
##Description

This lab is for NASA API usage and shows how using the get requests with the JSON data
can be used to create a console application for research.

##Issues
Some issues I had with this application were that the indexing for the nested JSON list 
items wasn't working, but I found out that the JSON lists were just singular objects and
did not need to be iterated through.
